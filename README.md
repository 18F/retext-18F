# retext-mapbox-standard

Enforce Mapbox rules about language.

Enforces:

* Acronym & term styling, like GeoJSON rather than geoJSON
* Brand styling, like Mapbox instead of MapBox
* Sensitive language - includes [retext-equality](https://github.com/wooorm/retext-equality)

    npm install -g retext-mapbox-standard
