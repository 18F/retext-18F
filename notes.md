"facilitate" suggestion doesn't work (_ease_ or _help_)

"inbumbent upon" suggestion doesn't work (_must_)
    - i.e. `It's incumbent on them` should go to `They must`

"Innovative" is part of OCSIT

clarify "citizens" prompt

remove "there is" — ?

dialogue — sometimes technical

"your office" --> "your" often doesn't work

"collaborate" --> "working with" doesn't parse the same (should be "work together" or other)

false positives for "drop-down" correction

gendered pronoun correction should NOT suggest "it"

no problem with `he'll` if correct for that person

#NEXT STEPS

1. Tadhg to figure out how to make addition, deletion and provision of explanation and/or source URL for terms easy to enter.
2. Write docs and/or scripts to make it easy for users to tweak terms files and run them locally to see results.
3. Decide on whether or not to keep retext-equality dependency.
4. Evaluate and decide whether or not to write our own tool entirely.
